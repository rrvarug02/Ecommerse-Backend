# E-Commerce Backend

## Description

This is a complete backend solution for an e-commerce platform, built with Node.js. It leverages Express.js to manage the server and API routing, while PostgreSQL is used as the database, with Sequelize serving as the ORM to enable database interactions directly within the JavaScript code.
